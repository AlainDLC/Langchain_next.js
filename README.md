# ðŸ§  RAG Chatbot Trained on Your Data

This is a personal project where Iâ€™m building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** chatbot trained on **my own data**. The goal is to **dive deeper into the RAG concept** using modern technologies like **LangChain.js**, **Next.js**, **Gemini API**, and **Vercel**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To explore how to:

- Load and chunk custom documents (e.g., PDF, Markdown)
- Create vector embeddings with the **Gemini API**
- Retrieve relevant context via a vector database
- Build an intelligent chatbot using **LangChain.js** and **Gemini**
- Develop a fast frontend with **Next.js**
- Deploy everything on **Vercel**

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Next.js** â€“ React-based framework for modern web apps
- **LangChain.js** â€“ Framework for building LLM-powered applications
- **Gemini API** â€“ For embeddings and language model capabilities
- **Vercel** â€“ Deployment and hosting platform
- **Vector search** â€“ For retrieving relevant context from your data
